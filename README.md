# ExploratoryDataAnalysis
Coursera - JHU

Using data from the EPA (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip) I have analysed the change of PM2.5 (particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter) between 1999 and 2008, in the United States.

I have printed 6 bar charts (with the code, so it can be replicated) to show what I discovered.

plot1) Total annual emmisions of PM2.5 have reduced greatly btween 1999 and 2008, where it reduced to more than half the amount in 2008
plot2) Baltimore's total annual emmisions have reduced between 1999 and 2008, but at a lesser rate than the average of the US. Also the reduction has not been steady, as in 2005 emissions increased compared to 2002.
plot3) The majority of the PM2.5 pollution comes from Non Point pollution (pollution created in a wide area, e.g. water run off, excess herbicides, fertiliser in agricultural, residential waste, etc). For Non Road, Non Point and On Road pollution they have been reducing every year, however Point pollution increased in 2002 and even greater in 2005, before reducing to levels similar to 1999. This may have been because of the Financial Crisis and not EPA policy.
