plot1) Total annual emmisions of PM2.5 have reduced greatly btween 1999 and 2008, where it reduced to more than half the amount in 2008

plot2) Baltimore's total annual emmisions have reduced between 1999 and 2008, but at a lesser rate than the average of the US. Also the reduction has not been steady, as in 2005 emissions increased compared to 2002.

plot3) The majority of the PM2.5 pollution comes from Non Point pollution (pollution created in a wide area, e.g. water run off, excess herbicides, fertiliser in agricultural, residential waste, etc). For Non Road, Non Point and On Road pollution they have been reducing every year, however Point pollution increased in 2002 and even greater in 2005, before reducing to levels similar to 1999. This may have been because of the Financial Crisis and not EPA policy.

plot4) Coal combustion related sources of PM2.5 reduced slightly, but not significantly until 2008, where there was a great decrease. This may be becuase the 2008 Financial Crisis.

Plot5) Emissions from motor vehicles in Baltimore City have reduced greatly between 1999 and 2002 and have continued to decrease up until 2008.

plot6) The scales of PM2.5 between Baltimore City and Los Angeles are very different, but Los Angeles is a larger city with a larger population compared to Baltimore City. If this was scaled with population size, we would get a more represented scale of average pollution per person from motor vehicles. What the data does show is that since 1999, Los Angeles pollution continued tp increase until 2005, where it dropped down in 2008, but this was still higher than 1999 levels. If we compare this to Baltimore, where pollution has continued to decrease every year since 1999. Baltimore may have better intitiates than Los Angeles in tackling vehicle pollution (e.g. better public transport, incentives to use cleaner energy, cycle lanes, etc)
